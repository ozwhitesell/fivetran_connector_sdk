# README: BMW VIN Decoder Connector for Fivetran

## **Overview**
This project is a **BMW VIN Decoder Connector** that integrates with **Fivetran**. It is designed to extract vehicle information and recall details from a **public API** and send it to a **database or data warehouse** using Fivetran.

## **What Does This Connector Do?**
- **Decodes a BMW VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)** to retrieve vehicle details such as model, year, engine type, and manufacturing plant.
- **Fetches recall information** for a BMW vehicle.
- **Formats the extracted data** and sends it to **Fivetran**, which loads it into a database for analysis.

## **Who Is This For?**
- **Data Analysts & Engineers** who need structured vehicle data.
- **Businesses & Dealerships** tracking BMW vehicle recalls and details.
- **Anyone integrating BMW vehicle data into a data warehouse using Fivetran.**

## **How It Works (Simple Steps)**
1. The **VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)** is provided as input.
2. The script makes a request to a **government API** that holds vehicle details.
3. The response includes **vehicle specifications** and **recall history**.
4. The script processes the data into a **structured format**.
5. The processed data is **sent to Fivetran** for storage and analysis.

## **Key Components**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **BMWVinDecoder Class**
- Connects to the **public API** to fetch vehicle details.
- Extracts relevant details like **model, year, engine type, and recalls**.
- Supports **error handling** for failed API requests.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Fivetran Integration**
- Defines **data tables** that store the decoded vehicle details.
- Uses Fivetran‚Äôs built-in functions to **insert or update data** in the database.
- Supports **state management**, ensuring only new data is synced.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Logging & Debugging**
- Logs errors and API request issues.
- Can be tested locally using the `fivetran debug` command.

## **How to Run the Connector**
### **Option 1: Local Testing**
1. Ensure **Python** is installed on your machine.
2. Install required dependencies (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas fivetran-sdk
   ```
3. Run the connector in debug mode:
   ```bash
   python connector.py
   ```

### **Option 2: Deploy with Fivetran**
1. Configure **Fivetran** to recognize the connector.
2. Ensure the correct **VIN numbers** are provided in the configuration.
3. Monitor the sync process via the **Fivetran dashboard**.

## **Troubleshooting**
üîπ **Problem: API request failure**  
‚úî Check internet connection or API availability.

üîπ **Problem: No data returned for VIN**  
‚úî Ensure the VIN is correct and belongs to a **BMW vehicle**.

üîπ **Problem: Error during execution**  
‚úî Check the logs for error messages and debug accordingly.

## **Conclusion**
This **BMW VIN Decoder Connector** simplifies **retrieving BMW vehicle data** and **syncing it to a database** using **Fivetran**. üöóüí®
